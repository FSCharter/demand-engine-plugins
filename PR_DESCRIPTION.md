# Distance-Based Plugin Rebalancing + Long-Haul Boost

## Summary

This PR implements a comprehensive rebalancing of FSCharter's demand plugins, replacing airport-type-based restrictions with distance-based classifications that trust the geoscore system. Additionally, it increases long-haul weight from 120 to 150 to address player demand for widebody opportunities while maintaining healthy cash flow distribution.

**Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Implemented industry-standard haul distance classifications (Eurocontrol-based)
- ‚úÖ Removed airport type restrictions (trust geoscores)
- ‚úÖ Achieved ¬±1% class distribution accuracy (60% E / 25% B / 15% F)
- ‚úÖ Increased long-haul weight by 25% (120 ‚Üí 150) for better widebody availability
- ‚úÖ Maintained GA/charter platform identity
- ‚úÖ Balanced cash flow considerations with player demand

**Total Active Weight:** 888 (was 858, was 920 initially)

## Philosophy & Approach

### Core Principle: Trust the Geoscore System

**Old System:**
- Plugins restricted by airport type (large/medium/small) + distance
- Fights against the geoscore allocation system
- Creates artificial constraints

**New System:**
- Plugins restricted by distance only
- Geoscores handle airport selection naturally
- Distance defines mission profile, geoscore defines where

**Why This Works:**
- Geoscores already encode population, tourism, economy, entity influence
- Airport type restrictions fight against the scoring system
- Self-maintaining: new airports automatically integrated
- Player freedom: "Fly where you want" within distance bands

---

## Problems Solved

### 1. Unrealistic Haul Distance Classifications

**Problem:** Original distance bands didn't match industry standards
- "Long Haul": 300+ nm (barely short-haul by real standards!)
- "Medium Haul": 100-300 nm (too short)
- "Short Haul": 30-100 nm (too short)

**Solution:** Implemented Eurocontrol industry-standard classifications
- Very Short Haul: 10-270 nm
- Short Haul: 270-800 nm
- Medium Haul: 800-2,200 nm
- Long Haul: 2,200+ nm

### 2. Passenger Class Distribution Imbalance

**Problem:** Initial distribution was skewed
- Economy: 57.5% (target: 60%) - **-2.5%**
- Business: 21.9% (target: 25%) - **-3.1%**
- First: 20.6% (target: 15%) - **+5.6%**

**Root Causes:**
- Too many first-class-only plugins
- Missing first class on realistic routes (medium haul, ski resorts)
- Incorrect class assignments (helicharter as economy)

**Solution:** Expanded most plugins to [E/B/F], added economy-heavy routes
- regional_connector (E/B, 2-8 pax)
- domestic_trunk (E/B, 3-10 pax)
- budget_international (E/B, 4-12 pax)

### 3. Group Size Accounting Error

**Discovery:** Initial calculations ignored passenger group sizes
- Only considered plugin weights, not actual passenger-units
- Executive Group Charter (10 avg pax) overwhelmed distribution
- First class was over-represented in actual passenger counts

**Solution:**
- Proper calculation: weight √ó avg_passenger_count √ó class_probability
- Reduced Executive Group Charter: 25 ‚Üí 15 weight
- Achieved ¬±1% accuracy across all classes

### 4. Insufficient Widebody Opportunities

**Problem:** Player feedback indicated "not enough long-haul"
- Widebodies (747, 777, 787, A330, A350) are iconic, aspirational aircraft
- Only 17.9% direct coverage (16.55% effective after cascading)
- Players want more long-haul opportunities

**Solution:** Increased long_haul weight 120 ‚Üí 150
- Raises effective widebody coverage to 18.80%
- 13% improvement in widebody mission availability
- Maintains cash flow balance (see detailed analysis below)

## Industry-Standard Distance Classifications

Implemented Eurocontrol-based distance bands that match real-world aviation terminology:

| Classification | Distance | Weight | Purpose | Real-World Examples |
|----------------|----------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **Very Short Haul** | 10-270 nm | 80 | City shuttles, regional feeders | Regional feeders, island hops |
| **Short Haul** | 270-800 nm | 180 | Regional routes | London-Paris (215nm), NYC-Boston (190nm) |
| **Medium Haul** | 800-2,200 nm | 150 | Domestic/regional | NYC-Chicago (730nm), LA-NYC (2,150nm) |
| **Long Haul** | 2,200+ nm | 150 | International long-haul | NYC-London (2,990nm), LA-Tokyo (4,700nm) |

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Matches industry terminology
- ‚úÖ Clear aircraft progression path
- ‚úÖ Realistic mission profiles
- ‚úÖ Maintains class distribution balance

## Long-Haul Weight Increase Analysis

### The Player Demand Problem

**Player Feedback:** "A lot of people want to fly widebodies"
- 747, 777, 787, A330, A350 are iconic, aspirational aircraft
- Long-haul international flying is the dream for many sim pilots
- Current 16.55% effective coverage feels restrictive

### The Cash Flow Constraint

**Critical Discovery:** FSCharter's payment model creates cash flow pressure

From the help docs:
> Passengers pay **only on passenger's final destination arrival**

**Impact on Long-Haul:**
- **Leg 1 (GA pickup)**: Fly passengers to hub ‚Üí **no payment yet**
- **Leg 2 (long-haul)**: Fly hub ‚Üí destination hub ‚Üí **no payment yet**
- **Leg 3 (GA dropoff)**: Fly to final destination ‚Üí **FINALLY GET PAID**

**Cash Flow by Route Type:**
- Short-haul (270-800nm): Get paid in 1-2 hours ‚úÖüí∞
- Medium-haul (800-2,200nm): Get paid in 3-4 hours ‚úÖüí∞
- Long-haul (2,200+nm): Get paid in 6-12+ hours ‚ö†Ô∏èüí∞

### Why Not Higher Weight? (180, 200, 250)

We analyzed scenarios from 150 to 250. Higher weights were rejected because:

**Scenario 180 (+60):**
- Widebody: 20.84% effective coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Creates moderate cash flow delays
- Risk: Players feel pressure to fly long-haul despite slower income

**Scenario 200 (+80):**
- Widebody: 22.10% effective coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GA drops to 20.32% (concerning, near 20% threshold)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant cash flow delays
- Risk: Platform identity shifts toward airline operations

**Scenario 250 (+130):**
- Widebody: 24.94% effective coverage (nearly 1 in 4 missions)
- ‚ùå GA drops to 19.88% (below 20% threshold)
- ‚ùå Platform becomes airline-focused
- ‚ùå Major cash flow problems

### Why 150 is the Sweet Spot

**Financial Health:**
- ‚úÖ Players still have 60%+ short/medium missions for quick cash flow
- ‚úÖ Long-haul becomes a strategic choice, not a cash flow trap
- ‚úÖ New players can build capital before tackling long-haul

**Player Satisfaction:**
- ‚úÖ 18.80% effective widebody (up 13% from 16.55%)
- ‚úÖ Addresses "not enough long-haul" feedback
- ‚úÖ Keeps long-haul aspirational and rewarding

**Platform Identity:**
- ‚úÖ GA stays strong at 20.83%
- ‚úÖ Short-haul (fast cash) remains prevalent
- ‚úÖ Balanced progression: GA ‚Üí Regional ‚Üí Long-haul

### Comparison Table

| Scenario | Effective WB% | GA% | Cash Flow | Player Experience |
|----------|---------------|-----|-----------|-------------------|
| **120 (baseline)** | 16.55% | 21.18% | Best cash flow | "Not enough long-haul!" ‚ùå |
| **150 (chosen)** | 18.80% | 20.83% | **Good balance** ‚úÖ | "Decent long-haul available" ‚úÖ |
| 180 | 20.84% | 20.51% | Moderate delays | "Great for WB pilots" ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| 200 | 22.10% | 20.32% | Significant delays | "Too much long-haul?" ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è |

### Real-World Demand Distribution

In production, demand is **already highly distributed** across 32k+ airports:

**Observed Pattern from Screenshots:**
- Major hubs show 4-8 passenger groups per destination
- Dozens of different destinations from each hub
- Requires network building to aggregate passengers

**Impact:**
- Singles/Twins: Find 2-4 passengers ‚Üí fly immediately ‚úÖ
- Turboprops: Find 6-10 passengers ‚Üí moderate coordination
- Regional Jets: Find 20-50 passengers ‚Üí need network building
- Narrowbodies: Find 70-150 passengers ‚Üí need serious hub operations
- Widebodies: Find 180-400 passengers ‚Üí need EXTENSIVE hub network + multi-leg coordination

**Conclusion:** The work to fill a widebody is naturally constrained by passenger aggregation requirements, so increasing long-haul weight to 150 provides more opportunities without overwhelming the system.

## Class Distribution Achievement

**Target Distribution:**
- Economy: 60%
- Business: 25%
- First: 15%

**Achieved Distribution (Accounting for Group Sizes):**

| Class | Target | Achieved | Delta | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Economy | 60.00% | **60.58%** | +0.58% | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Business | 25.00% | **24.70%** | -0.30% | ‚úÖ PASS |
| First | 15.00% | **14.72%** | -0.28% | ‚úÖ PASS |

**Result: All within ¬±1% tolerance - EXCELLENT**

### How This Was Achieved

1. **Expanded most plugins to [E/B/F]**
   - Used 60:25:15 weighted cabin selection
   - Applies automatically when all three classes present

2. **Added economy-heavy routes to balance first-class specialty plugins**
   - regional_connector (E/B)
   - domestic_trunk (E/B)
   - budget_international (E/B)

3. **Proper group size accounting**
   - Calculation: weight √ó avg_passenger_count √ó class_probability
   - Executive Group Charter reduced to account for high passenger count (10 avg)

4. **Realistic class restrictions**
   - Bush Taxi: E only (basic transport)
   - Corporate: F only (C-suite jets)
   - Helicharter: B/F only (premium service)
   - Military: E only (service personnel)

## Aircraft Market Coverage

Analysis shows healthy coverage across all aircraft categories:

| Aircraft Type | Suitable Plugins | Weight | Coverage |
|---------------|------------------|--------|----------|
| **Singles (1-3 pax)** | Very Short, Bush, Water, Heli | 120 | 13.5% ‚úÖ |
| **Light Twins (4-6 pax)** | Very Short, Short | 260 | 29.3% ‚úÖ |
| **Turboprops (6-19 pax)** | Short, Medium, Regional Island, Island Hopper | 395 | 44.5% ‚úÖ |

| **Large Biz Jets (8-15)** | Executive Group, Medium, Long | 315 | 35.5% ‚úÖ |

**Key Improvements:**
- Widebodies: 17.9% ‚Üí 20.7% direct coverage (+15.6%)
- All aircraft types have viable mission availability
- Clear progression path from GA ‚Üí Regional ‚Üí Long-haul

## Hub-and-Spoke Cascading Demand

### The Cascading Effect

FSCharter's collaborative hub-and-spoke network creates **cascading demand** where long-haul flights generate feeder traffic:

**Key Insight:** 1 long-haul passenger needs 3 flight segments:
1. **Pickup**: Home ‚Üí Hub (GA/regional/short-haul)
2. **Long-haul**: Hub ‚Üí Destination Hub (widebody)
3. **Dropoff**: Destination Hub ‚Üí Final destination (GA/regional/short-haul)

This is a **MULTIPLIER effect**, not additive!

### Cascading Demand Model

With long_haul weight = 150:

| Hub Plugin | Base Weight | Avg Pax | Cascade Rate | Feeder Demand Created |
|------------|-------------|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| **long_haul** | 150 | 3.5 | 60% | 315 passenger-units |
| **medium_haul** | 150 | 3.5 | 40% | 210 passenger-units |
| **domestic_trunk** | 60 | 6.5 | 50% | 195 passenger-units |
| **budget_international** | 34 | 8.0 | 30% | 82 passenger-units |

**Total Cascading Feeder Demand:** ~802 passenger-units

This feeder demand distributes to:
- Regional Connectors (30%)
- Short Haul (25-30%)
- Very Short Haul (20-25%)
- Corporate/Helicopter (10%)
- Bush/Water Taxi (5%)

### Impact on Effective Aircraft Coverage

| Aircraft Type | Direct Coverage | Effective Coverage (after cascade) | Change |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------|
| **Widebodies** | 20.72% | 18.80% | **-1.92%** ‚Üì |
| **Narrowbodies** | 16.89% | 15.33% | -1.56% ‚Üì |
| **Regional Jets** | 34.91% | 35.91% | +1.00% ‚Üë |
| **Turboprops** | 19.14% | 20.83% | +1.69% ‚Üë |
| **Light Twins** | 19.14% | 20.83% | +1.69% ‚Üë |
| **Singles** | 19.14% | 20.83% | +1.69% ‚Üë |
| **Business Jets** | 5.52% | 6.57% | +1.05% ‚Üë |

**Key Findings:**
- Total effective weight: **979** (vs 888 direct) = **1.10x multiplier**
- GA/regional aircraft benefit from cascade effect (feeder demand)
- Widebody coverage diluted slightly by feeder generation
- Creates natural hub-and-spoke patterns organically

### Why This Is Correct for FSCharter

**Real airlines optimize for:**
- Scheduled trunk routes (narrowbodies dominate)
- Hub efficiency (minimize GA spillover)
- Load factor maximization (bigger planes)

**FSCharter is a player-driven GA/charter platform:**
- ‚úÖ Players START with small aircraft (singles, twins)
- ‚úÖ Hub spillover creates GA opportunities (charter demand)
- ‚úÖ Island operations (turboprops, regional jets)
- ‚úÖ Business jet charters (executive travel)
- ‚úÖ Distributed across 32,000+ airports (not concentrated at hubs)

**Result:** Our GA-heavy distribution is **INTENTIONALLY correct**!

## Implementation Details

### Files Changed

**Modified Plugins (15 files):**

1. **Distance Reclassifications:**
   - `very_short_haul.jsonplugin` - NEW (10-270nm, weight 80)
   - `short_haul.jsonplugin` - 30-100nm ‚Üí 270-800nm, weight 95 ‚Üí 180
   - `medium_haul.jsonplugin` - 100-300nm ‚Üí 800-2,200nm, weight 123 ‚Üí 150
   - `long_haul.jsonplugin` - 300+nm ‚Üí 2,200+nm, weight 298 ‚Üí 120 ‚Üí **150**

2. **Class Distribution Fixes:**
   - `executive_group_charter.jsonplugin` - weight 25 ‚Üí 15
   - `helicharter.jsonplugin` - [E] ‚Üí [B/F], weight 20 ‚Üí 15

   - `corporate.jsonplugin` - weight 50 ‚Üí 19
   - `bush_taxi.jsonplugin` - weight 20 ‚Üí 15

3. **Economy-Heavy Additions:**
   - `regional_connector.jsonplugin` - NEW (E/B, 2-8 pax, weight 70)
   - `domestic_trunk.jsonplugin` - NEW (E/B, 3-10 pax, weight 60)
   - `budget_international.jsonplugin` - NEW (E/B, 4-12 pax, weight 34)

4. **Disabled Plugins:**
   - `ultra_short.jsonplugin` - weight 15 ‚Üí 0 [absorbed into very_short_haul]
   - `ski_resort.jsonplugin` - weight 25 ‚Üí 0 [trust geoscores]
   - `military_transfers.jsonplugin` - weight 25 ‚Üí 0 [merged into military_flights]

### Critical Rules Applied

1. **Passenger counts = traveling group sizes**, NOT plane capacity
   - Hard limit: 12 passengers per group (CommodityValidationFilter.cs:12)
   - Groups are combined onto planes by the matching system

2. **Class distribution accounting**
   - weight √ó avg_passenger_count √ó class_probability
   - High passenger counts have outsized impact on distribution

3. **Weighted cabin selection (60:25:15)**
   - System maintains target distribution automatically
   - Applies when plugins include [E/B/F]

## Testing & Validation

### Pre-Deployment Validation

**1. Class Distribution Verification:**
```python
# Run the validation script
python3 /tmp/long_haul_rebalancing_analysis.py

# Expected results:
# Economy:  60.58% (target 60.00%, deviation: +0.58%) ‚úì PASS
# Business: 24.70% (target 25.00%, deviation: -0.30%) ‚úì PASS
# First:    14.72% (target 15.00%, deviation: -0.28%) ‚úì PASS
```

**2. Weight Calculations:**
- Total active weight: 888
- All plugins sum correctly
- No negative weights

**3. Distance Band Validation:**
- No gaps in distance coverage
- No overlapping restrictions
- Industry standards matched

### Recommended Production Testing

**Phase 1: Generate Test Demand (1-2 hours)**
1. Generate 10,000 test missions
2. Verify class distribution: 60/25/15 ¬±1%
3. Verify widebody frequency: ~18.8% (effective after cascade)
4. Check for unexpected patterns

**Phase 2: Soft Launch (1 week)**
1. Deploy to beta/test environment
2. Monitor player behavior and feedback
3. Track cash flow patterns (are players solvent?)
4. Measure widebody mission acceptance rate

**Phase 3: Full Deployment (2 weeks)**
1. Production deployment
2. Monitor key metrics:
   - Class distribution (telemetry)
   - Widebody utilization
   - Player cash flow health
   - Mission completion rates by distance
3. Gather player feedback via Discord/surveys

**Phase 4: Adjustment (if needed)**
1. If widebody demand still too low: Consider 150 ‚Üí 180
2. If cash flow issues: Consider 150 ‚Üí 120-130
3. If class distribution drifts: Adjust economy-heavy plugins
4. Likely range: 120-180 based on real-world data

### Success Metrics

**Must Have (Critical):**
- ‚úÖ Class distribution within ¬±1%: E 60%, B 25%, F 15%
- ‚úÖ No game-breaking bugs or demand generation failures
- ‚úÖ Player cash flow remains healthy (no mass bankruptcies)

**Should Have (Important):**
- ‚úÖ Positive player feedback on widebody availability
- ‚úÖ Widebody missions accepted at reasonable rate
- ‚úÖ GA missions still popular (not abandoned for long-haul)
- ‚úÖ Business jet progression path viable

**Nice to Have (Desirable):**
- ‚úÖ Natural hub-and-spoke patterns emerge
- ‚úÖ Player collaboration increases (multi-leg journeys)
- ‚úÖ Regional diversity in demand (not concentrated)
