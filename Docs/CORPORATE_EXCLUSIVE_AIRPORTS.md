  "KTEB", "LFPB", "KVNY", "EGLF", "EDFE", "LFMD", "OMAD"
];

// Tier 2: Verified business jet capable (72 airports)
const tier2Corporate = [
  // North America (26)
  "KOPF", "KPDK", "KAPA", "KMMU", "KADS", "KSQL", "KPAO", "KLVK",
  "KCRQ", "KHWO", "KTMB", "KFRG", "KAPF", "KORL", "KRAL", "KSEE",

// Apply in executive_group_charter.jsonplugin
{
  "originAirport": tier1Corporate.concat(tier2Corporate),
  "destinationAirport": tier1Corporate.concat(tier2Corporate),
  // ... existing config
}
```

### Movement-Based Weighting
Apply multipliers based on verified annual movements:

| Airport | Multiplier | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| EDFE | 2.5x | 80,000 movements - Germany's busiest GA |
| KTEB | 2.0x | 74,832 movements - Global leader |
| LFMD | 1.8x | 70,000 movements (seasonal peak) |
| LFPB | 1.5x | 54,724 movements - Europe leader |
| KAPA | 1.3x | 337,947 movements |
| KVNY | 1.2x | 32,229 movements |
| EGLF | 1.2x | ~30,000 movements |
| Others | 1.0x | Base weight |
