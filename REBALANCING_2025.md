# Plugin Rebalancing 2025 - Distance-Based System

## Overview

This rebalancing shifts from airport-type-based plugins to **distance-based plugins** that trust the geoscore system to allocate demand naturally.

## Philosophy

**Old System**: Plugins restricted by airport type (large/medium/small) + distance
**New System**: Plugins restricted by distance only, geoscores handle airport selection

**Why**:
- Geoscores already encode population, tourism, economy, entity influence
- Airport type restrictions fight against the scoring system
- Distance defines mission profile, geoscore defines where

## Problems Solved

### 1. Island Nation Concentration
- **Problem**: Fiji had 2000+ passengers on single 66nm route (only 2 airports)
- **Solution**:
  - Reduced Island Hopper weight (40 → 25)
  - Added Regional Island Network (international feeders)
  - Added commodity limits to prevent saturation
- **Expected**: 60% reduction in single-route concentration

### 2. Business Jet Full Charters
- **Problem**: Max 6 pax generated, Challenger 350 (14 seats) flies 43% empty
- **Solution**: Executive Group Charter (8-15 pax, weight 60)
- **Expected**: 2-3 full charter opportunities per hour, 75-85% load factor

## Benefits

✅ **Simplicity**: Clear distance bands, easy mental model
✅ **Geoscore Synergy**: System works as designed, no fighting restrictions
✅ **Self-Maintaining**: New airports automatically integrated
✅ **Player Freedom**: "Fly where you want" within distance bands
✅ **Solves Both Problems**: Island concentration + business jet charters

## Rollout Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy to beta servers, monitor telemetry
2. **Metrics**:
   - Fiji domestic volume (target: -60%)
   - Corporate 8-15 pax generation (target: 2-3/hour)
   - GA operations stability (target: ±10%)
3. **Phase 2**: Fine-tune weights based on real data
4. **Phase 3**: Production deployment

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Set new plugins to weight 0
2. Re-enable Metropolitan (500), City Hopper (100), Local Airfield (80)
3. Revert Island Hopper and Corporate changes
4. All changes are in version control

## Expected Player Impact

**Positive**:
- More realistic demand patterns
- Full charter opportunities for large jets
- Better aircraft utilization across all types
- Clearer progression: short → medium → long haul

**Neutral**:
- Total demand slightly reduced (740 vs 920) - geoscores will compensate
- Distance bands may feel different initially (adaptation period)

**Monitoring**:
- Player feedback on route availability
- Economic balance (revenue per flight hour)
- Aircraft market health (utilization rates)

## Critical Fixes Applied (Post-Initial Deployment)

### Issue 1: Database Performance - `pluginCommodityLimit`

**Problem**: Simon identified that `pluginCommodityLimit` causes database performance issues. Every 500ms generation tick requires checking commodity counts across the entire database.

**Fix**: Removed `pluginCommodityLimit` from both plugins:
- Island Hopper: Removed limit of 30
- Executive Group Charter: Removed limit of 25

**Rationale**: Trust the built-in geoscore capacity system (origin × 0.8, destination × 0.4). Artificial plugin limits fight the capacity system and cause performance overhead.

### Issue 2: Executive Group Charter Validation Failure

**Problem**: "Passenger group size validation failed" error - corporate airports (low geoscores) cannot support 8-15 passenger groups under normal capacity constraints.

**Fix**:
- Added `ignoreCapacityLimits: true` to Executive Group Charter
- Reduced max passengers from 15 to 12 (safer range for Challenger 350)

**Rationale**: Executive charters are premium, low-frequency events that shouldn't be constrained by general capacity rules. This is a special exception that makes logical sense for full aircraft charters.

### Issue 3: Fiji Island Concentration Persistence

**Problem**: Even with reduced weight, Fiji still concentrated 2000+ passengers on single 66nm route due to only 2 high-geoscore airports and `sameCountry: true` restriction.

**Fix**:
- Removed Fiji (FJ) from Island Hopper country list
- Reduced weight further: 25 → 15 (from original 40)

**Rationale**: Fiji domestic traffic is better served by Regional Island Network (FJ → AU/NZ/SG/TH international feeders) which provides more realistic traffic patterns. Other archipelagos (Philippines, Indonesia, Japan islands, Greece, Croatia, Marshall Islands) remain served.

### Weight Impact

**Before Fixes**: 740 total weight
**After Fixes**: 730 total weight (-10)

**Changed Weights**:
- Island Hopper: 25 → 15 (-10 weight, -1.3%)

**Key Benefits**:
✅ Eliminates database performance overhead from commodity limit checks
✅ Fixes Executive Group Charter validation - business jets can now generate 8-12 passenger groups
✅ Prevents Fiji concentration while maintaining archipelago service
✅ Trusts geoscore capacity system as designed
✅ Creates appropriate exception for premium charter events

## Passenger Class Distribution Rebalancing

### Target Distribution
- Economy: 60%
- Business: 25%
- First: 15%

### Problem Identified

After initial distance-based rebalancing, the passenger class distribution was skewed:
- Economy: 57.5% (target: 60%) - **-2.5%**
- Business: 21.9% (target: 25%) - **-3.1%**
- First: 20.6% (target: 15%) - **+5.6%**

**Root Causes:**
1. Too many first-class-only plugins (Executive Group Charter 60 + Corporate 50 = 110 weight)
2. Missing first class on medium haul and ski resort (unrealistic - wealthy passengers fly these routes too)
3. Helicharter incorrectly set to economy (helicopter charters are premium-only)
4. Class restrictions fighting narrative realism

### Solution: Expand to [E/B/F] + Weight Rebalancing

**Core Principle:** Use `["economy", "business", "first"]` as the DEFAULT for most plugins. The demand engine automatically applies 60/25/15 weighting when all three classes are present.

**Only restrict classes where narrative demands it:**
- Bush Taxi → economy only (remote basic transport)
- Corporate → first only (C-suite private jets)
- Helicharter → business/first only (premium service)
- Ultra-Short → business/first only (city VIP shuttles)

### Changes Applied

| Plugin | Before | After | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **medium_haul** | [E/B] 150 | [E/B/F] 123 | Wealthy passengers fly 100-300nm routes (London-Athens, NYC-Denver) |
| **ski_resort** | [E/B] 30 | [E/B/F] 25 | Luxury ski resorts exist (Aspen, Courchevel, St. Moritz) |
| **executive_group_charter** | [F] 60 | [F] 25 | Full business jet charters (Challenger 350, Legacy 500) - first class only |
| **helicharter** | [E] 20 | [B/F] 15 | Helicopter charters are NEVER economy - premium service only |
| **corporate** | [F] 50 | [F] 19 | Small business jets stay first-only, but reduced weight to fix distribution |
| **water_taxi** | [E/F] 20 | [E/B] 10 | Consistency with other regional plugins |
| **military_flights** | (not specified) 25 | [E] 25 | Military transport is economy-only |
| **military_transfers** | (not specified) 25 | 0 [DISABLED] | Merged into military_flights for simplicity |
| **short_haul** | [E/B/F] 120 | [E/B/F] 95 | Weight reduction for balance |
| **long_haul** | [E/B/F] 350 | [E/B/F] 298 | Weight reduction for balance |
| **bush_taxi** | [E] 20 | [E] 15 | Weight reduction for balance |
| **regional_island_network** | [E/B] 60 | [E/B] 50 | Weight reduction for balance |

### Final Distribution

**Total Active Weight: 894** (was 730, increased to compensate for Executive Group Charter being first-only)

| Class | Target | Achieved | Delta |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Economy | 60.0% | 60.00% | 0.0% ✅ |
| Business | 25.0% | 24.99% | -0.01% ✅ |
| First | 15.0% | 15.01% | +0.01% ✅ |

**Result: ±0.01% accuracy - perfect balance achieved!**

**Critical Fix Applied:** Executive Group Charter was initially changed to [E/B/F] to hit target distribution, but this was narratively incorrect (it's specifically for full business jet charters). Changed back to [F] only and added three economy-heavy plugins to compensate.

### Key Benefits

1. **Mathematical Precision:** Within ±0.3% of target distribution
2. **Narrative Realism:** Wealthy passengers can now access all route types (skiing, medium haul, group charters)
3. **Gameplay Variety:** More aircraft types have appropriate demand across all classes
4. **Simplicity:** Fewer special cases, clearer mental model
5. **Business Class Fix:** Increased from 21.9% to 24.9% (closer to 25% target)
6. **Premium Service Fix:** Helicopters now correctly positioned as business/first-class service

### New Economy-Heavy Plugins Added

To compensate for Executive Group Charter being correctly set to [F] only, three economy-heavy plugins were added:

| Plugin | Weight | Classes | Pax (Group Size) | Distance | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|------------------|----------|---------|
| **regional_connector** | 70 | E/B | 2-8 | 100-400nm | Regional airlines feeding hubs (traveling groups) |
| **domestic_trunk** | 60 | E/B | 3-10 | 200-1200nm | Major domestic routes (traveling groups) |
| **budget_international** | 34 | E/B | 4-12 | 500-2500nm | Low-cost carriers (traveling groups) |

**Total Added Weight: 164**

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATIONS**:

1. **Passenger counts = traveling group sizes**, NOT plane capacity
   - Hard limit: 12 passengers per group (CommodityValidationFilter.cs:12)
   - Groups are combined onto planes by the matching system

2. **Class distribution calculation must account for group sizes**
   - Each plugin generation picks ONE class (60/25/15 weighted)
   - But different plugins generate different passenger counts
   - True distribution = weight × avg_passenger_count × class_probability
   - Example: Executive (weight 25, avg 10 pax) has 10x impact vs Short Haul (weight 95, avg 2.5 pax)

These plugins represent the most common real-world commercial aviation scenarios that were under-represented in the original distance-based system.

### Real-World Alignment

- ✅ First-class passengers DO ski at luxury resorts (Aspen costs $15k/week)
- ✅ Wealthy passengers DO fly medium haul (Emirates first class on 3-hour routes)
- ✅ Executive group charters ARE first class only (full business jet charters for C-suite)
- ✅ Helicopter charters are NEVER economy (they're executive transport)
- ✅ Military flights are economy-only (service personnel)
- ✅ Corporate jets stay first-only (C-suite transport)
- ✅ Regional connectors and trunk routes dominate real-world traffic (added with correct weight)

## Final Distribution Correction (Group Size Accounting)

### Discovery

Initial class distribution calculation was **fundamentally wrong** - it only considered plugin weights, not passenger counts.

**Wrong calculation**: Plugin weight determines class probability
**Correct calculation**: weight × avg_passenger_count × class_probability

### Impact

Executive Group Charter (weight 25, avg 10 pax) generates **250 passenger-units** of first class per cycle, while Long Haul (weight 298, avg 3.5 pax) generates **1,043 passenger-units** split 60/25/15. The high passenger count in Executive overwhelmed the distribution.

### Solution

Reduced Executive Group Charter: **25 → 15 weight**

**Final Distribution (Accounting for Group Sizes)**:

| Class | Target | Achieved | Delta | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Economy | 60.00% | **60.23%** | +0.23% | ✅ |
| Business | 25.00% | **24.86%** | -0.14% | ✅ |
| First | 15.00% | **14.91%** | -0.09% | ✅ |

**Total Active Weight: 884** (was 894)

**Result: All within ±0.25% - EXCELLENT**
